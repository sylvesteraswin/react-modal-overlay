# Button

This component clearly communicates what action will occur when the user touches it.

It consists of text, and image, or both.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-zvui-framework/lib/button';

const Button = () => (
  <Button
      primary
      icon="favorite_border"
      label="Primary Button" />
  );
```
